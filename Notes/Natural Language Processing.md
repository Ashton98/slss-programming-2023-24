# Natural Language Processing
## Output
We can use a function to display text and symbols to the screen
We use the `print()` function to display output

```python
print("Your text goes in here.")
```

> Task
> 1. open Visual Studio Code
> 2. make sure that it's open to your repository
> 3. create a new file called `input_and_output.py`

## [[Headers]]

## Comments
Comments are pieces of text that are *not* interpreted by Python.
This means that the text is **ignored**.  
We use the # symbol to make comments.

```python
# This is a comment
```

> Task
> 1.  In `input_and_output.py1`
> 	1. Put the header
> 	2. Write in some comments
